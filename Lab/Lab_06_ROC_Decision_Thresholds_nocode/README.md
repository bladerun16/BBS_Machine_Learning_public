# Fit a probabilistic classifier for a binary problem and set the threshold for the final decision
Use a classifier that is reliable to predict probabilities

Use the ROC Area Under Curve as score for optimisation

Try several thresholds to see the behavior of precision, recall and f1-score

Try a few selected threshold
