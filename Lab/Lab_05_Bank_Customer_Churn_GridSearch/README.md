# Lab 05 – Bank Customer Churn Prediction with GridSearchCV

## Objectives
- Load and inspect a bank customer churn dataset
- Prepare data for machine learning:
  - Define feature matrix (X) and target vector (y)
  - Encode categorical variables
  - Split data into training and testing sets
- Compare multiple classification models using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision (macro)
  - Recall (macro)
  - F1-score (macro)
- Visualise the best model using confusion matrices

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of classification metrics
- Familiarity with GridSearchCV
- Knowledge from Labs 03 and 04

## Notes
This lab extends hyperparameter tuning to **multiple models** and focuses on
systematic comparison and evaluation.
