## Lab notebooks and data
The lab will be assisted by the tutor.
Each lab session will be organised as follows:

- the folder of each assignment will contain a notebook and an html file 
	- the notebook has the suffix `_nocode`; it contains
		- the description of the assignement
		- empty cells that you are expected to fill with python code
		- the expected output of the cell
	- the html file is just the static version of the notebook, you can use it as a reference to compare the outputs that you generate with the expected ones
- the `data` folder will contain the data used in the assignments
- the __solution__ of the previous lab will be added to the respective lab folder before the new lab
